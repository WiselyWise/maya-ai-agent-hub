  In a production environment, this script would:
  1. Iterate through each route
  2. Render the app at that route
  3. Extract metadata from react-helmet
  4. Write a static HTML file with the correct metadata
  
  For now, we're relying on client-side rendering with react-helmet-async
  which provides good SEO as long as search engines execute JavaScript
  (which most modern ones do, including Google).
